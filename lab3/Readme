1. directory:
./client :  
          client directory, including: source file(client_tcp.c) , binary file(client), responsed server html file (*.html) 
./server :
          server directory, including : source file(server_tcp.c), binary file(server), local html file (index.html) 


2. Build: make all 
THEN both client and server will be compiled into binary files:
./client/client 
./server/server

3. Execute:

Open at least two separated terminal for client and server. 

a) client :   ./client <server address> <server port> <destination html in http server>

b) server :   ./server <server_port> 


4. Tests 

<Test1> local client + internet web server :  client access standard http server. 
  step1: start http client to request file "index.html" from server under directory ./server: 
          "./client www.w3.org 80 https://www.w3.org/home.html";
  step2: Checking running log.
         "Received content size: 40424 bytes."
         "The cost time: 2."  
         (notes: add extra 1.6 sleep time in code for easily display too small time cost).
  step3: Responsed file be stored under ./client/home.html
         Use firefox to open this html file.
         
         
<Test2> local client + local server :  client read "index.html" at local server. 
  step1: start web server with listening port under directory ./client: 
         "./server 1234";
  step2: start http client to request file "index.html" from server under directory ./server: 
         "./client localhost 1234 index.html";
  step3: Checking running log.
         "Received content size: 11307 bytes."
         "The cost time: 1."  
         (notes: add extra 1.6 sleep time in code for easily display too small time cost).
  step4: Responsed file be stored under ./client/index.html
         Use firefox to open this html file.
         
<Test3> local client + local server :  client read non-existed file from local server. 
  step1: start web server with listening port under directory ./client: 
         "./server 1234";
  step2: start http client to request file "index.html" from server under directory ./server: 
         "./client localhost 1234 non_existed_file.html";
  step3: Checking running log.
         "Received content size: 359 bytes."
         "The cost time: 1."  
         (notes: add extra 1.6 sleep time in code for easily display too small time cost).
  step4: Responsed file be stored under ./client/non_existed_file.html
         Use firefox to open this html file.
 
 <Test4> local client + local server :  client read "index.html" without "read permission" from local server. 
  step1: start web server with listening port under directory ./client: 
         "./server 1234";
  step2: start http client to request file "index.html" from server under directory ./server: 
         "./client localhost 1234 index.html";
  step3: Checking running log.
         "Received content size: 359 bytes."
         "The cost time: 1."  
         (notes: add extra 1.6 sleep time in code for easily display too small time cost).
  step4: Responsed file be stored under ./client/index.html
         Use firefox to open this html file.
