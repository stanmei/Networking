HOW TO BUILD:    make <option> 
      1) Iterative tcp server: 
            run "make iter"  , then it will generate object file " server_tcp_iter"             
      2) Concurrent Multiprocessing server with one process per request 
            run "make mpr"  , then it will generate object file " server_tcp_mpr" 
      3) Concurrent Multithreading server with one thread per request 
            run "make mth"  , then it will generate object file " server_tcp_mth" 
      4) Concurrent Pre-forked Multiprocessing server
            run "make ppr"  , then it will generate object file " server_tcp_ppr" 
      5 Concurrent Pre-threaded Multithreading server 
          run "make pth"  , then it will generate object file " server_tcp_pth" 

HOW TO RUN:
     1)  Iterative tcp server:
      ./server_tcp_iter 1234
      2) Concurrent Multiprocessing server with one process per request 
       ./server_tcp_mpr 1234
      3) Concurrent Multithreading server with one thread per request 
      ./server_tcp_mth 1234
      4) Concurrent Pre-forked Multiprocessing server
      ./server_tcp_ppr 1234 
      5 Concurrent Pre-threaded Multithreading server 
      ./server_tcp_pth 1234      
      
HOW TO CLEAN:
      run "make clean", it will clean object files and binary file
