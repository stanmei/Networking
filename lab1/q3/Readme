BUILD:
     run make, and it will generate a binary: daytime_client_tcp

Running:

    1) One ntp server:
     ./daytime_client_tcp time.nist.gov      
     
    2) Two ntp server :
    ./daytime_client_tcp time.nist.gov  time.nist.gov   
     

Notes:
      1) To print difference, sleep (2) s after first time service. Then final time difference is : 2 s.

Testcase :

1) running client to visit two servers with 2 s interval :
   ./daytime_client_tcp time.nist.gov  time.nist.gov  
   
2) Sever will response daytime and difference between these two response is : 2s
