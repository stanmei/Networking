HOW TO BUILD :    make <option> 

      1) Iterative udp server + client: 
            run "make iter"  , then it will generate object file " server_udp_iter"             
      2) Concurrent Multiprocessing server with one process per request  + client: 
            run "make mpr"  , then it will generate object file " server_udp_mpr" 
      3) Concurrent Multithreading server with one thread per request + client: 
            run "make mth"  , then it will generate object file " server_udp_mth" 
      4) Concurrent Pre-forked Multiprocessing server + client: 
            run "make ppr"  , then it will generate object file " server_udp_ppr" 
      5 Concurrent Pre-threaded Multithreading server + client: 
          run "make pth"  , then it will generate object file " server_udp_pth" 
  

HOW TO RUN:
     1)  Iterative udp server + client: 
      ./server_udp_iter 1234
      ./client_udp localhost 1234 <test file name> 
      
      2) Concurrent Multiprocessing server with one process per request + client: 
       ./server_udp_mpr 1234
       ./client_udp localhost 1234 <test file name> 
      
      3) Concurrent Multithreading server with one thread per request + client: 
      ./server_udp_mth 1234
      ./client_udp localhost 1234 <test file name> 
      
      4) Concurrent Pre-forked Multiprocessing server+ client: 
      ./server_udp_ppr 1234 
      ./client_udp localhost 1234 <test file name> 
      
      5 Concurrent Pre-threaded Multithreading server + client: 
      ./server_udp_pth 1234   
      ./client_udp localhost 1234 <test file name> 
   
   Then under same directory, the recived content will be writed into: rx_<test file name>
   
      
HOW TO CLEAN:
      run "make clean", it will clean object files and binary file
